# Targeted Pole Selection

- When processing input data, check for a user-provided list of pole numbers.
- If a list is provided:
  - Normalize each pole ID using the `normalize_pole_id` function from `processor/utils.py`.
  - Filter the processing to include only poles matching these normalized IDs.
- If no list is provided, proceed to process all available poles.
- Log the number of poles specified and the number successfully matched and processed.
