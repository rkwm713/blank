# Make-Ready Report Generator `.clinerules`

This directory contains project-specific rules for the Make-Ready Report Generator. These rules guide Cline in implementing key features:

1. **Targeted Pole Selection**: Allows users to specify a list of pole numbers to process, enhancing performance and focus.

2. **Conflict Resolution Strategy**: Provides users with options to resolve data discrepancies between Katapult and SPIDAcalc sources.

3. **Map Component Integration**: Enhances the results page with an interactive map displaying processed poles using Leaflet.js.

Each rule is defined in its respective Markdown file within this directory. Adjustments to these rules should be made with consideration to maintain consistency and functionality across the application.
