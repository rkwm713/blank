## 1. Objective

Document the identified cause and the required code modification to fix the issue where the highest neutral wire, and any other attachments at its exact height, are not being listed in the "Attacher Description" column of the Make-Ready Excel report. The root cause is a strict less-than comparison in the height filtering logic within the `neutral_identification.py` module.

## 4. Processing Requirements & Logic

* **Neutral Wire Identification:**
    * Create a robust function to identify neutral wires across different data sources
    * In Katapult, check `traces` linked from photo annotations (`photofirst_data.wire._trace`)
    * In SPIDAcalc, check `usageGroups` for "NEUTRAL" indicators
    * Implement pattern matching for variations in neutral wire descriptions (e.g., "NEUTRAL", "CPS Energy Neutral")
    * Normalize wire descriptions before pattern matching using existing `normalize_owner` function
    * Return the highest identified neutral wire for each pole

* **Height Data Normalization:**
    * Ensure consistent unit handling for comparing attachments with neutral wires
    * Convert Katapult heights (inches) and SPIDAcalc heights (meters) to a standard unit (inches)
    * Implement validation to catch and log invalid height values
    * Flag attachments with missing or invalid height data for review

* **Attachment Filtering Logic:**
    * The core of the issue lies in the `identify_attachments_below_neutral` function within `neutral_identification.py`.
    * **Problem Identified**: The function currently uses a strict less-than comparison:
      ```python
      if attachment_height_inches < neutral_height:
      ```
      This logic excludes the neutral wire itself and any other attachments located at the exact same height as the identified highest neutral.
    * **Required Change**: Modify the comparison operator to be less-than-or-equal-to (`<=`) to include attachments at the neutral's height.
      The line should be changed from:
      `if attachment_height_inches < neutral_height:`
      To:
      `if attachment_height_inches <= neutral_height:`
    * **Impact**: This change will ensure that the list of attachments returned by `identify_attachments_below_neutral` (and subsequently used by `excel_generator.py` for the "Attacher Description" column) includes the highest neutral and all attachments at or below its height.
    * The existing behavior for poles where no neutral wire is found (i.e., returning all attachments) should be preserved.

* **Data Visualization for Debugging:**
    * Add debug output showing all attachments with their heights relative to the neutral
    * Create a text-based visualization that marks the neutral line position
    * Log numeric heights alongside display format (e.g., "3'-4\"") for easier validation

## 5. Known Issues or Special Conditions for This Task

* **Confirmed Root Cause**: The specific issue of the highest neutral (and attachments at its exact height) not being listed is directly caused by the `attachment_height_inches < neutral_height` comparison in `neutral_identification.py`.
* While general robustness of neutral wire *identification* across various data patterns is an ongoing concern (as noted by existing points), the filtering logic for *already identified* neutrals is the focus of this specific fix.
* The edge case of attachments being at the exact same height as the neutral is directly addressed by the proposed change to `<=`.
* The logic for selecting the *highest* neutral among multiple identified neutrals is handled by `get_highest_neutral` and is considered upstream of this filtering issue.
* The behavior when no neutral is found (returning all attachments, as logged by `identify_attachments_below_neutral`) is the current standard handling.

---

## 6. Completion Criteria

* [x] The comparison in `neutral_identification.py`'s `identify_attachments_below_neutral` function is changed from `<` to `<=`.
* [x] Testing confirms that the Make-Ready Excel report now correctly lists the highest neutral wire and any other attachments at its exact height in the "Attacher Description" column (Column L).
* [x] Test scenarios should include poles where attachments exist at the exact same height as the highest neutral.
* [x] Verification using production sample files (if available) that previously demonstrated this issue shows the problem is resolved.
* [x] Existing functionality, such as handling poles with no identifiable neutral, remains unchanged and correct.
